## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to establish how MakeHaven will
handle decision making when there exists a possible conflict of
interest, particularly for MakeHaven's board members.

## Typesetting

requires a [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) installation
to produce a PDF.  For Mac OS X, you can use the
